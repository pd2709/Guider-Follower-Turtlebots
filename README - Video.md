# Video for Guider-Follower-Turtlebots using a Marker
SCMS-AUT2022

This video explains how we completed the Guider-Follower Turtlebots project. Our attempted methods are discussed in the video as well as the actual method implemented. Footage is included of the actual Turtlebots where the follower turtlebot actually follows the guider Turtlebot. Our code's logic is explained through a flow chart and each step of the flowchart is explained in detail.
